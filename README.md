Credit card is one of the modern payment methods widely spread all over the world.
It provides excellent facilities in purchasing as well as selling operations. In the present world, we are facing a lot of credit card problems. 
Credit card fraud happens when the card was stolen for any of the unauthorized purposes or even when the fraudster uses the credit card information for his use. 
However, it suffers from fraud problems, causing considerable economic losses to banks, institutions, and individuals, amounting to billions of dollars annually. 
That has made great interest in finding systems and means with outstanding capabilities to confront fraud, whose patterns in addition to methods are increasing dramatically.
One of the most prominent techniques used by researchers in this field is Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In this project, we proposed, Authentication System which generates an Dynamic RFID Schema Code, so that sniffing of the Signal from the   Card will be no use. Then we will proceed with Machine Learning (ML) techniques, Random Forest Algorithm (RFA) for finding the fraudulent transactions. 
The pre-Implemented RFA with Kaggle Dataset applied into a feature change from the authenticator will be developed.
